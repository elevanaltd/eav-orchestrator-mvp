# EAV Orchestrator MVP

Production-ready foundation with proven paragraph=component architecture for video production workflow.

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission

This MVP has successfully validated the core architecture for EAV Orchestrator. The **paragraph=component model** with TipTap editor integration is proven and operational, ready for production hardening.

## âœ… Architecture VALIDATED

```
USER TYPES â†’ Single TipTap Editor â†’ Y.js Document Structure â†’ Component Extraction
                      â†“                    â†“                         â†“
             Google Docs-like UX    Single Source of Truth    Stable Component IDs (C1, C2, C3...)
                      â†“
             Components Flow: Script â†’ Scenes â†’ Voice â†’ Edit (1:1 mapping)
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Add your VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and VITE_SMARTSUITE_API_KEY

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run quality gates
npm run validate  # Runs lint, typecheck, and tests
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

**User Feedback:** "Working really well. Better than I could have thought." - Architecture validation successful.

## ðŸ“Š Current Status: Phase 2 Complete

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Architecture (COMPLETE)
- [x] TipTap editor with paragraph=component model
- [x] Component extraction (C1, C2, C3...) working perfectly
- [x] Visual component markers with left-margin labels
- [x] Supabase integration with auth system
- [x] SmartSuite integration framework operational

### âœ… Phase 2: Professional UI Enhancement (COMPLETE)
- [x] Authentication system with login/signup
- [x] Navigation sidebar with project/video hierarchy
- [x] Auto-save with 2-second debouncing
- [x] Script persistence across video navigation
- [x] Header with user display and logout
- [x] ScriptStatus integration showing component counts
- [x] Auto-refresh navigation (30-second intervals)
- [x] Professional UI ready for stakeholder demos

### ðŸ”§ Production Readiness Gaps (Identified)
**Security (CRITICAL):**
- [ ] Input validation with Zod required
- [ ] XSS protection via DOMPurify needed
- [ ] Content Security Policy headers missing

**Performance (HIGH):**
- [ ] Race conditions in auto-refresh logic
- [ ] Bundle size optimization (currently 839KB)
- [ ] N+1 query patterns in video loading

**Architecture (MEDIUM):**
- [ ] Error boundaries for component isolation
- [ ] React testing warnings need resolution

## ðŸ”— Integration

### Supabase Cloud
- **Project:** zbxvjyrbkycbfhwmmnmy
- **Auth:** Fully configured with RLS policies
- **Database:** 5 normalized tables (projects, videos, scripts, script_components, user_profiles)

### SmartSuite
- **Workspace:** s3qnmox1
- **Videos Table:** 68b2437a8f1755b055e0a124
- **Projects Table:** 68a8ff5237fde0bf797c05b3
- **Sync Pattern:** One-way (SmartSuite â†’ Supabase)

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics Achieved

1. **Paragraph=component model:** âœ… Working intuitively
2. **Component identity:** âœ… Preserved throughout system (C1, C2, C3...)
3. **TipTap editing:** âœ… Natural Google Docs-like experience
4. **SmartSuite integration:** âœ… Framework operational
5. **Production path:** âœ… Clear with identified gaps

## ðŸ“Š Quality Gates Status

```bash
npm run lint       # âœ… 0 errors, 0 warnings
npm run typecheck  # âœ… TypeScript compilation clean
npm run test       # âœ… 35/35 tests passing
npm run validate   # âœ… All quality gates pass
```

## ðŸš§ Next Steps for Production

### Immediate (BLOCKING):
1. Add input validation (Zod)
2. Implement XSS protection (DOMPurify)
3. Fix race conditions in auto-refresh
4. Add error boundaries

### Short-term:
1. Optimize bundle size with code splitting
2. Add CSP headers
3. Fix React testing warnings
4. Implement E2E tests

### Production Features (Post-MVP):
1. Real-time collaboration (Y.js full implementation)
2. Workflow tabs (Script â†’ Review â†’ Scenes â†’ Voice â†’ Edit)
3. Advanced error recovery
4. Performance monitoring

## ðŸ“Š Parent Project Learnings Applied

This MVP successfully applies critical learnings:
- âœ… Single TipTap editor (not component-by-component)
- âœ… Server-side component extraction
- âœ… Minimal database schema approach
- âœ… Direct error visibility (no circuit breakers in dev)
- âœ… Atomic saves preventing data loss

**Status:** Architecture Validated - Production Hardening Required
**Achievement:** Phase 2 Complete - Professional UI Delivered
**Decision:** Ready for production development with identified security/performance fixes
